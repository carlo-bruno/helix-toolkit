# Helix Toolkit

## Motivation

I want to create a web app of tools that will help me create and update my Helix/HX Stomp patches

## Features:

- Online Preset viewer
  - Show what is in a preset without firing up HX Edit/Helix Native
  - Show multiple patches at the same time
- Blocks pastebin
  - Have boxes where I can paste a block and all its settings so I can copy/paste different effects with ease
- Preset Diff (highlight difference between 2 presets)
  - Highlight difference between 2 presets
- Tuner
  - Always on Tuner, can be turned off or hidden
